This is a simple project that uses Youtube Data APIs to get the youtube data and store it MongoDB database (datalake). And from mongodb fetch the unstructured date and transform it to a structured data and store it in RDBMS (MySQL in this project). Once this process is one, using streamlit we can view the data in the required way.
